The University of Rwanda currently faces a significant challenge in the absence of a centralized platform to effectively celebrate and share students' achievements & university life as well as publish opportunities. The existing disparity not only results in a fragmented representation of student achievements but also impedes community engagement and efficient communication.
To address these issues, the proposed project aims to create a dedicated website that unifies and enhances the digital presence of the university community. This platform will serve as a comprehensive hub for celebrating student achievements, sharing university opportunities & experiences, and fostering efficient communication such as News and Announcements; Community Engagement Tools; Virtual Campus Tour.
This website, URMEDIA HUB, has to be developed using Laravel.
